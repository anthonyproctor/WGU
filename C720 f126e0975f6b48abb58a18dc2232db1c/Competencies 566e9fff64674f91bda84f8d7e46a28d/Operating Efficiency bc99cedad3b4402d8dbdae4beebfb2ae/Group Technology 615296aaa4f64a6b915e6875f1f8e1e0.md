# Group Technology

Group technology (GT) - production system may be used to make several different, but related, parts. The idea behind GT is that each part follows the same essential processing sequence. By keeping similar parts together, setup time is reduced, and the flow of materials is not interrupted.

If excessive time is taken for the setup, then the flow of materials will be stopped - causing downstream processing operations to pause until the flow resumes.

If “upstream” operations continue unchecked, unnecessary inventory will build up in the system, much as water builds up when a dam is placed across a river.

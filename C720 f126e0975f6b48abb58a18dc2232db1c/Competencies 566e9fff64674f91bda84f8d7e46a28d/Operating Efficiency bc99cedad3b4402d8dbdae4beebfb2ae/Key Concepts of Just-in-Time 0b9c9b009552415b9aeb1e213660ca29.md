# Key Concepts of Just-in-Time

- Manufacturing in a continuous flow process
- Uses general purpose machinery
- Produces in small batches or small lot sizes
- Uses a PULL system
- Uses process facility layout
- Simplifies the production process by;
    - Reducing setup times
    - Having workers work in close proximity - reducing “motion”
    - Using total preventative maintenance (preventing machinery breakdowns)
- Use Kanban cards
- Produces in a small lot sizes and shorter planning horizons (2-3 moths vs 6-12 moths)

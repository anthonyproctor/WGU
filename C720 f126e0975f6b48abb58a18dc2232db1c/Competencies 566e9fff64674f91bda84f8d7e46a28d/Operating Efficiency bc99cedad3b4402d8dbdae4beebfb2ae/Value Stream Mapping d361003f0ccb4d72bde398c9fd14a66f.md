# Value Stream Mapping

Value stream mapping - is a technique used to analyze the flow of materials, ideas, and information to understand how processes function. Each activity in the process is defined as value added or non value added.

Identify the product or service that should be mapped.

Draw a rough, current state, value stream map that shows the current steps, delays, and information flows required to deliver the product or services.

Estimate the cost and timing at each point as well as the value added.

Assess the current state value stream map to understand its flow and identify points where waste occurs to determine where processes can be improved.

Create a future state value stream map using a team of people

Prepare a plan to implement these improvements.

Work towards this future state.

# Location Analysis

The factors that must be weighed when evaluating locations are grouped into three subsections:

1. Managing the quantitative factors, including the impact of location on cost and the increasing importance of government incentives.
2. Describing the qualitative factors and illustrating how these can be analyzed, as well as integrated with the quantitative factors.
3. Discussing the effects of the location decision on other operating factors.

# Design Capacity and Effective Capacity Metrics

Design Capacity is the maximum achievable output of a process or system

Effective Capacity - is the maximum capacity given the product mix, equipment change overs and scheduled downtime of the production schedule

Actual Output is the current level of production

Design Capacity is based on what a service firm or manufacturer can produce under ideal conditions for a short period of time. Everything is running perfectly - no equipment issues, supply. employee issues, etc. 

Capacity Utilization is a metric, or measure, used to determine how much capacity is actually used on an average basis.

- Capacity Utilization = Actual Output / Design Capacity

Efficiency Rate - is a metric used to determine how much effective capacity is being used to achieve output

- Efficiency Rate = Actual Output / Effective Capacity

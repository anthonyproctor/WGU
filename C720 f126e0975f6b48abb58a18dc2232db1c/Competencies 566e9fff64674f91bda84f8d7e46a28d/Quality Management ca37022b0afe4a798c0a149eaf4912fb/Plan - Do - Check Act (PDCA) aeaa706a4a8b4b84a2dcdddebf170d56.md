# Plan - Do - Check Act (PDCA)

Deming Wheel / Shewart Wheel - Whee that embodies continuous improvement

Modifies Walter Shewart’s Plan - Do - Check Act

- Plan - everything is documented, standardized; identify problems or opportunities for improvement
- Do - Implement the plan
- Check - analyze to determine if goals have been achieved
- Act - if the goals have been achieved; then standardized and document the changes. Communicate the results to others that could benefit from the changes. If the identified goals have not been achieved, determine why not and plan accordingly

PDSA - in 1986 Deming changed the “C” for Check to S for “Study” to allow for a more thorough review.

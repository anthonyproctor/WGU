Six sigma is a continuous improvement strategy that relates to a firm’s ability to produce error free products. Specifically, 3.4 defects per 1 million units. DMAIC

- Define - identification of a problem that requires fixing or improvement
- Measure - determine how the process is currently performing and defining the significance of the problem
- Analyze - involves determining what is causing the problem - to get to the root cause of the problem and brainstorming as to why the problem exists. This is when statistical process control occurs. Data is gathered around the problem and used to determine the best way to solve the problem
- Improve - determines where we are trying to go and the best way to move forward. The improved stage outlines how the process will be handled moving forward
- Control - monitor the situation to see if the problem has been solved. If it has, you go back to step one to see if there is another problem. If it hasn’t, you go back to step one and attempt to solve the same problem again
- DMA DV - The D and the V are for new products/ processes. There is no existing process so it has to be designed and you monitor the process by verifying the design and how it will be done moving forward.

# What is Forecasting?

- Forecasting is a type of mathematical model that can be used to predict the future. Forecasts are usually the result of examining past experiences to gain insights into the future.
- The insights often take the form of mathematical models that are used to project future sales, product costs, advertising costs, etc.
- Forecasting can also be used to estimate the cost of living, housing process, and federal debt.
- For organizations, forecasts are an essential part of planning. It would be illogical to plan for tomorrow without some idea of what could happen.

# Scheduling for Service

Schedule for Peak Demand

One possible approach to scheduling for services is to schedule for peak demand. That means that sufficient capacity will be available at all time to meet the peak expected demand. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for demand to be met at all times under normal conditions. Its greatest disadvantage is that a large portion of capacity may be idle a large percentage of the time. 

Chase Demand

There are two methods that companies use to adjust production rates to match demand - varying the workforce and using overtime.

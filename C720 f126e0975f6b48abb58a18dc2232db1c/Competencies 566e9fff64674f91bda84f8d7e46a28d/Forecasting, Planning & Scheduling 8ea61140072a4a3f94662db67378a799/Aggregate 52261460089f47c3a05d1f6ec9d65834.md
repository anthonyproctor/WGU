Aggregate Planning is the combining of individual end items into groups or families of parts for planning purposes.

The master schedule - master production schedule (MPS) - is based on the ‘aggregated” plan. The master production schedule “disaggregates the aggregate plan” because it is specific statement of exactly what will be produced and a specific date for production. The master production schedule usually stares individual end items or product models. The master schedule is, therefore, a detailed extension of the medium range operations plan, or aggrgate plan.

Critical characteristics of the MPS are an aggregate plan, bills of material, planning horizons, time fences, and width of the time bucket.

Answers what, when, and how much will be produced.

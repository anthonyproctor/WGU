# Scheduling for Services vs Products

- Scheduling services involves coordinating work tasks, people, materials, facilities, and equipment needed to create goods and services at an exact point in time. Scheduling is required for making goods and for providing services successfully.

- One major difference between scheduling the production of goods and scheduling the production of services is that a service cannot be inventoried.

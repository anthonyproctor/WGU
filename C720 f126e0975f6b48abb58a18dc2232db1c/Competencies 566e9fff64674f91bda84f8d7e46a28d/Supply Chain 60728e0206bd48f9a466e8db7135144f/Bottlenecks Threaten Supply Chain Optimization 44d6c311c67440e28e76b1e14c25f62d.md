# Bottlenecks Threaten Supply Chain Optimization

The increasing popularity of lean management - lean management encourages companies to focus on getting rid o excess inventory. Therefore, if there is an unexpected shortage, then there is nothing in reserve, ad the flow of goods and services halts until the shortage is addressed. 

The trend to outsource multiple parts of production and multiple processes in the supply chain - as supply chains get longer and more complex, it is easier to lose visibility of potential shortages until it is too late to react.

The consolidation of supply bases - as companies try to streamline their supply chains, they may end up single sourced to a supplier of their own parts, and that supplier may be the only source for others in the industry. When production is disrupted by a natural disaster, disease, strike, political unrest, regulatory changes, or some other factor, multiple industries may be affected.
